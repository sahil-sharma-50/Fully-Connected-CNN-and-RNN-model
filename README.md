# Fully-Connected-CNN-and-RNN-model
Developed a complex neural network model using Python that incorporates Fully Connected layers, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). The model includes key components such as Pooling, Dropout, Batch Normalization, Flatten, Sigmoid, Softmax, and Tanh layers.
