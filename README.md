# Fully-Connected-CNN-and-RNN-model
I developed a sophisticated neural network model in Python, which includes Fully Connected layers,
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). The model has components such
as Pooling, Dropout, Batch Normalization, Flatten, Sigmoid, Softmax, and Tanh layers.
## Achievements:
<ul>
  <li>Implemented CNN for improved feature extraction in image analysis.</li>
  <li>Integrated RNN to enhance prediction accuracy with sequential data.</li>
  <li>Applied Pooling and Dropout layers for robustness, and Batch Normalization for faster convergence.</li>
</ul>

## Technologies Used: 
<ul>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>TensorFlow/Keras</li>
</ul>
